A basic website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML page
- `styles.css`: Stylesheet for the website
- `script.js`: JavaScript for interactivity

## How to view
Use the Live Server extension in VS Code to serve the site. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server". It will open at http://localhost:5500.

Alternatively, open `index.html` directly in a web browser for a static view.
